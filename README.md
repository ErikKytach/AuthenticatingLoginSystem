<h1>Authentication Login System</h1>
<p>Create a simulation of a login system that prompts for a password and only displays the requested information if the entered password matches the predetermined one in the program. In case of an error, display an error message and prompt to retry the input. After 3 attempts, the program should display a message about an unauthorized attempt.</p>
To make the program more complex:

<ul>
  <li>Include a user database (login and password) and require not only the password but also the corresponding login.</li>
  <li>In case of an error in the login or password, display an appropriate error message.</li>
</ul>
